    "String slicing is a technique in Python that allows you to extract a subset of characters from a string. It's a powerful feature that enables you to manipulate strings with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- start is the starting index (inclusive)\n",
    "- stop is the ending index (exclusive)\n",
    "- step is the increment between indices (default is 1)\n",

    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extracting a substring\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: \"Hello\"\n",

    "10. Sort: Lists can be sorted in-place using the sort() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Reverse: Lists can be reversed in-place using the reverse() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Iteration: Lists support iteration, allowing you to loop through their elements using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Concatenation: Lists can be concatenated using the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Membership Testing: You can check if an element is in a list using the in operator.\n",
